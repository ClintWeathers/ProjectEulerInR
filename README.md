ProjectEulerInR
===============

I'm reworking all of my completed Project Euler problems in R. 

For the most part, I'm trying to stick with base R when possible. I will however, be shamlessly using
the Hadley Wickham packages (plyr, stringr, ggmap, ggplot2, reshape2, etc) and math packages that have 
functions pre-built for things are necessary but would be tedious (prime finding, etc). 

The key for me here is to work through the problem first in R so I get a better grasp on coding in the language
rather than just dinking around with it. After that, I can go back and redo things building my own functions for
stuff I used out of packages. 

Thus far I have 23 solved, almost all of them some sort of number theory. That's not out of a great love of 
number theory so much as those seem like the ones most easily done without a graduate-level math education. 

But I'll be tackling the big hairy ones too, as soon as I finish reworking these 23 in R.
