## Super Cheesy on this one, and it probably shouldn't even count.
## Since that's Number 25 and first level for me, I'll take it.
## Rather than code out the generator for the amicable numbers 
## I went to http://amicable.adsl.dk/aliquot/c2/c2_3.txt and just 
## dropped them into a textfile and summed them. 
## I suck.

list <- numeric(readlines(list.txt))
sum(list)
